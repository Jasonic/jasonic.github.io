# Example from Strunk & White

> There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the
ground.

``` Dead leaves covered the ground.```

> The sound of the falls could still be heard.

``` The sound of the falls still reached our ears.```

> The reason that he left college was that his health became
impaired.

```Failing health compelled him to leave college.```

> It was not long before he was very sorry that he had said
what he had.

```He soon repented his words```
